# CPSC547-CaseLawViz

Abstractâ€”Judicial Case Law Citation Timeline is an interactive visualization that looks at the relationships between case law citations (cross references) and case decisions (written judgements) related to the treatment of particular legal concepts over time for legal research and collaboration. The dataset comes from over 20,000 case laws contained in the BC Laws Database and will eventually be expanded to the over 2 million cases contained within the Canadian Legal Information Institute Database. The resulting visualization is presented as a Chord Diagram with each of the arcs representing a case, and each chord representing the citations between cases.
